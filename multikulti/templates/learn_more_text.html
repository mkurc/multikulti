<h2>About <span class="capi">cabs</span>-dock</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">So far, the major unsolved problem in protein docking is the treatment of proteins with substantial backbone conformational change. Based on the coarse-grained (<span class="capi">cg</span>) <span class="capi">cabs</span> model, we developed and present a <span class="capi">cabs</span>-dock web server for docking of peptides to proteins. Due to high efficiency of the <span class="capi">cg</span> approach, during molecular docking, <span class="capi">cabs</span>-dock treats peptide backbone as fully flexible, while the flexibility of receptor proteins is limited to near-native backbone fluctuations.
</br></br>
The <span class="capi">cabs</span>-dock method was developed, optimized and validated during the following simulation experiments: 
<ol>
 <li>simulations of folding and binding of an intrinsically disordered peptide [<a href="#ref"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> ref 1</a>];</li>
 <li> docking of antigen-mimicking peptides to antibody [<a href="#ref"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> ref 2</a>];</li>
 <li>docking of peptide co-activators to the nuclear receptors [<a href="#ref"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> ref 3-4</a>]. 
</ol>

In the all above mentioned validation tests peptides conformation were allowed to be fully flexible and no information about the binding site nor the peptide conformation was used. The docking results showed that the method is able to predict the near native complex arrangements. The validity of near-native dynamics of the
<span class="capi">cabs</span> model was also investigated in the recent studies [<a href="#ref"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> ref 5-6</a>].
</p>
<h3>Method description</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">The only data required as an input is peptide sequence and protein structure in <span class="capi">pdb</span> format (or a protein <span class="capi">pdb</span> code). The protein structure is used as a starting point for the <span class="capi">cabs</span> simulation of near-native dynamics. The resulted docking trajectory is analyzed and processed to provide useful description of modeling results in the following outputs: 
<ul>
<li>a set of representative protein models (in an all-atom resolution)</li>
<li>docking trajectory in <span class="capi">cg</span> format</li>
</ul>
An important attribute of <span class="capi">cg</span> protein models generated by the <span class="capi">cabs</span> is that their spatial resolution allows for reconstruction to all-atom, physically realistic models. The output set of all-atom models is generated through trajectory clustering and subsequent multi-step reconstruction procedures (the procedures were extensively tested in previous structure prediction studies) – see the figure below.
